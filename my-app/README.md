VRV Security Frontend Assignment
This repository contains the frontend code for my project, which I developed as part of the VRV Security assignment for the Frontend Intern position. This project uses React.js and focuses on creating a user-friendly and responsive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) interface.

The RBAC UI is designed to help administrators manage users, roles, and permissions, offering functionalities to:

Create, edit, and delete users
Assign roles and permissions dynamically to users
Search and filter users
Features
Dashboard:
You can view a comprehensive overview of users and their roles in the system.
Manage Users:
Add, edit, and delete users while managing their status (Active/Inactive).
Manage Roles:
Define new roles, edit existing roles, and delete roles as necessary.
Manage Permissions:
Assign and modify permissions for roles dynamically.
Search and Filter:
Search for users based on their name or email and filter them as needed.
Technologies Used
